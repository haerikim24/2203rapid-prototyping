## Week 2 - Exploring KE from Walking:

For this week, I read more in depth about the idea of harvesting kinetic energy from people stepping on something. The initial inspiration for the idea came from an article I saw last week about a dance floor that lit up using the energy of people stepping and dancing on top of it.

I found another article that delved deeper into the technical overview of how these floors work. This goes over two main models that converts the translational motion of stepping on something to a rotational motion used in an EM generator to induce voltage.

Here's a few pictures of the diagrams that this article provided:
