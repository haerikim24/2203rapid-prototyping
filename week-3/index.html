## Week 3
	
This week, we finalized a goal and general concept for our design. We will collect energy from the environment with the purpose of storing heat and then using this stored energy to cook food.
As part of the energy collection team, we looked at and discussed possible sources of energy. From this list, we looked up some basic parameters in order to calculate a rough estimate of how much energy we can realistically collect.
	
	* Rain: ~100 mW
	* Solar: ~1.28 kW
	* Wind: ~27.4 W
	* Human (KE from steps): ~28.2 W
	
A similar project called "Sun Buckets" created a model that collected and stored solar thermal energy using a parabolic reflector to heat a bucket (with phase-changing latent heat storage material inside) in direct sunlight for a few hours.
