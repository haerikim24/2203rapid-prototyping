## Week 1 - Initial Brainstorming

Here are the initial ideas our group has discussed this week about possible energy sources:
	1. Harvesting kinetic energy from a rider using a scooter
		* possibly to charge a phone, light something up, warm something up
	2. Squeezing a stress ball and harvesting energy through that compression/release
	3. Acoustic energy from loud alarms/sirens or inviting students to scream as a form of stress relief
	4. Drawing inspiration from a dance floor that lit up by harvesting energy from people dancing/stepping on it
		* can do something similar with walking down the infinite, going up/down stairs, jumping/dancing
